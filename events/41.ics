DESCRIPTION:This event runs from Thursday\, May 16\, 2013 at 9am through 
 Friday\, May 17\, 2013 at 5pm.\n\n Description:\n### Hardware\nThey're t
 aking the world by storm. Quad coptors\, remote control Lego Trains\, Ro
 bots\, cybernetic implants. The hardware world is being revolutionized i
 n so many ways and JavaScript with Node.js is charging ahead. We're aimi
 ng to push that charge forward with a track dedicated to hardware hackin
 g\, so bring your ideas\, your hardware\, your code &amp\; let's hack.\n
 \n### Software\nCode\, it's in every thing we touch these days. JavaScri
 pt is stepping into new code realms everyday\, in the browser\, server\,
  phone\, databases\, map reductions\, your house and even in places we'v
 e no idea yet. Where are we heading next with JavaScript\, what else sho
 uld we do with it? Come hear about and contribute to the coolest develop
 ments in the world of JavaScript.\n\n###Independent\nWe love this stuff.
  We love building things. We do this for the fun of it and because we ju
 st can't not do it! We love that it provides so much monetary value to s
 ociety\, as companies actually pay us to do this stuff. Otherwise we'd b
 e starving artists\, and we're cool with good food.\n\nTags: user:jerrys
