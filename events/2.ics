DESCRIPTION:This event runs from Friday\, November 16\, 2012 at 9am throu
 gh Saturday\, November 17\, 2012 at 6pm.\n\n Description:\nMobX - your p
 remier annual conference for Mobile User Experience\, small screen Inter
 action Design and usable interfaces on smart devices.\n\nThis conference
  is for all you creative minds out there who deal with User Experience\,
  interfaces and interactions in mobile contexts. It’s not really for d
 evelopers (but we do love you\, nonetheless). MobX is for all those who 
 love small\, mobile interfaces and smart experiences\, good usability an
 d consistent behaviour.\n\nThere are a multitude of mobile gadgets\, pho
 nes and tablets out there\, with a mind-boggling variety of interfaces 
 – with often dubious usability. We operate small screens in cars\, tra
 ins and planes and elsewhere.\n\nOr is there no such thing as a mobile d
 evice\, as some say\, just mobile context? A star-studded line-up of int
 ernational experts and mobile thinkers will give us their take on this a
 nd other key topics. (And there will be time to party as well!)\n\nJoin 
 us in Berlin and learn from the best.\n\nTags: user:caseorganic\, user:a
