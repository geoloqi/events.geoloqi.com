DESCRIPTION:This event runs from Friday\, October 12\, 2012 at 6pm throug
 h Sunday\, October 14\, 2012 at 3am.\n\n Description:\nWhereCampPDX is a
  free\, volunteer-created unconference for anyone interested in geograph
 y and technology. This yearâ€™s event will be happening October 12th-14t
 h\, 2012 with a full day of unconference sessions at Metro Regional Cent
 er on the 13th.\n\nAn unconference is a conference planned by the partic
 ipants. We convene together\, plan sessions\, and break-out into the pro
 posed session discussions and activities. This gives everyone an opportu
 nity to bring to the table the things that interest them the most\, and 
 talk about emerging topics that are still new and exploratory. We value 
 open participation\, providing access to new voices\, and lowering barri
 ers to participation. As a result\, the event is driven by the interests
  and talents of the participants.\n\nTags: user:caseorganic\, user:aaron
