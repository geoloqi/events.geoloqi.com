DESCRIPTION:This event runs from Tuesday\, May 28\, 2013 at 3pm through S
 aturday\, June 1\, 2013 at 4pm.\n\n Description:\nJSConf is a unique con
 ference organization\, because we aren't really a conference organizatio
 n at all. We are a very loose federation of developers who share the sam
 e general idea about how a technical conference should be held. We don't
  believe that one model or process fits all communities\, in fact we are
  big advocates of locally run events driven by passionate individuals de
 dicated to the community. We make events that aren't from the standard c
 onference playbook because we believe you (attendees\, speakers\, and sp
 onsors) deserve more than that. We focus on two things\, pushing the bou
 ndaries of what is thought to be conceivable with JS and providing excep
 tional human social activities that encourage community and friendship b
 uilding. That sets the general tone for each of our events and from ther
 e\, local individuals from each region drive the conference to its own i
 ncredible level of excellence. Our mission is to make the technology com
 munity better\, more diverse\, and more human\; in short\, we just want 
 to make things better. JSConf does not focus on what is popular or cool 
 now\, but on topics that define and revolutionize the following year of 
 technology. We have been the launching point for some of the most revolu
 tionary products\, services\, and technologies on the web. We have also 
 been the inspiration point and support base for a wide range of conferen
 ces beyond the &quot\;JSConf&quot\; name.\n\nTags: user:jerrysv\, jsconf
