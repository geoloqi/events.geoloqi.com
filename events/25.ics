DESCRIPTION:Just a few months ago\, The Pebble E-paper Watch project rece
 ived a record-breaking $10.2 million through Kickstarter in a widespread
  show of support from a community of 68\,000+ micro-funders. And all thi
 s support was for a product that doesnâ€™t exist\, from an individual wi
 th no track record of success. A few years ago\, this would have been co
 nsidered a stroke of good luck\, yet as of July 3\, 2012\, there have be
 en over 62\,000 launched projects on Kickstarter (3\,973 are currently i
 n progress)\, with a steady success rate of approximately 44%. The compl
 eted successful projects have raised a total of $229 million. If you hav
 e an idea\, you can design your idea\, create a prototype\, pitch the id
 ea to the world using simple video-making programs (e.g.\, Photobooth) a
 nd fund a newly invented startup within a few days or weeks.\n\nThis pan
 el is about discussing the commoditization of entrepreneurship and the f
 uture of bringing ideas to the marketplace.\n\nTags: user:caseorganic\,
