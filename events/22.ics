DESCRIPTION:Join us for the first meeting of the Portland Node users grou
 p. We'll have food\, code\, and a lovely presentation about Terraformer 
 from Esri by Jerry Sievert. \n\n--What is Terraformer?--\n\nTerraformer 
 is a library for converting geographic data between different mapping fo
 rmats and GeoJSON. But it's more than that\, it's a Geo-Toolkit that wor
 ks in node as well as in the browser via AMD or CommonJS\, providing too
 ls for reading and writing from multiple geo formats\, converting to and
  from web mercator\, an RTree index\, and some simple polygon tools.\n\n
 You can check it out at https://github.com/geoloqi/Terraformer\n\nWe'll 
 also get cracking on what direction we'd like to take the group!\n\n\nTa
